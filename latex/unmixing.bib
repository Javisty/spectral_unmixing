	abstract = {Over the past decades, enormous efforts have been made to improve the performance of linear or nonlinear mixing models for hyperspectral unmixing (HU), yet their ability to simultaneously generalize various spectral variabilities (SVs) and extract physically meaningful endmembers still remains limited due to the poor ability in data fitting and reconstruction and the sensitivity to various SVs. Inspired by the powerful learning ability of deep learning (DL), we attempt to develop a general DL approach for HU, by fully considering the properties of endmembers extracted from the hyperspectral imagery, called endmember-guided unmixing network (EGU-Net). Beyond the alone autoencoder-like architecture, EGU-Net is a two-stream Siamese deep network, which learns an additional network from the pure or nearly pure endmembers to correct the weights of another unmixing network by sharing network parameters and adding spectrally meaningful constraints (e.g., nonnegativity and sum-to-one) toward a more accurate and interpretable unmixing solution. Furthermore, the resulting general framework is not only limited to pixelwise spectral unmixing but also applicable to spatial information modeling with convolutional operators for spatial-spectral unmixing. Experimental results conducted on three different datasets with the ground truth of abundance maps corresponding to each material demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the EGU-Net over state-of-the-art unmixing algorithms. The codes will be available from the website: https://github.com/danfenghong/IEEE\_TNNLS\_EGU-Net.},

	abstract = {Hyperspectral unmixing is an important processing step for many hyperspectral applications, mainly including: 1) estimation of pure spectral signatures (endmembers) and 2) estimation of the abundance of each endmember in each pixel of the image. In recent years, nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) has been highly attractive for this purpose due to the nonnegativity constraint that is often imposed in the abundance estimation step. However, most of the existing NMF-based methods only consider the information in a single layer while neglecting the hierarchical features with hidden information. To alleviate such limitation, in this paper, we propose a new sparsity-constrained deep NMF with total variation (SDNMF-TV) technique for hyperspectral unmixing. First, by adopting the concept of deep learning, the NMF algorithm is extended to deep NMF model. The proposed model consists of pretraining stage and fine-tuning stage, where the former pretrains all factors layer by layer and the latter is used to reduce the total reconstruction error. Second, in order to exploit adequately the spectral and spatial information included in the original hyperspectral image, we enforce two constraints on the abundance matrix. Specifically, the L1/2 constraint is adopted, since the distribution of each endmember is sparse in the 2-D space. The TV regularizer is further introduced to promote piecewise smoothness in abundance maps. For the optimization of the proposed model, multiplicative update rules are derived using the gradient descent method. The effectiveness and superiority of the SDNMF-TV algorithm are demonstrated by comparing with other unmixing methods on both synthetic and real data sets.},

	abstract = {The spectral signatures of the materials contained in hyperspectral images (HI), also called endmembers (EM), can be signiﬁcantly affected by variations in atmospheric, illumination or environmental conditions typically occurring within an HI. Traditional spectral unmixing (SU) algorithms neglect the spectral variability of the endmembers, what propagates signiﬁcant mismodeling errors throughout the whole unmixing process and compromises the quality of its results. Therefore, large efforts have been recently dedicated to mitigate the effects of spectral variability in SU. This resulted in the development of algorithms that incorporate different strategies to allow the EMs to vary within an HI, using, for instance, sets of spectral signatures known a priori, Bayesian, parametric, or local EM models. Each of these approaches has different characteristics and underlying motivations. This paper presents a comprehensive literature review contextualizing both classic and recent approaches to solve this problem. We give a detailed evaluation of the sources of spectral variability and their effect in HI spectra. Furthermore, we propose a new taxonomy that organizes existing work according to a practitioner’s point of view, based on the necessary amount of supervision and on the computational cost they require. We also review methods used to construct spectral libraries (which are required by many SU techniques) based on the observed HI, as well as algorithms for library augmentation and reduction. Finally, we conclude the paper with some discussions and an outline of possible future directions for the ﬁeld.},

DSCN++ is used to compute high-level representations which are further modeled with Multinomial Mixture Model to estimate abundance maps. In the reconstruction step, a new trainable uncertainty term based on a nonlinear neural network model is introduced to provide robustness to endmember uncertainty. For the optimization of the coefﬁcients of the multinomial model and the uncertainty term, Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) is exploited to improve stability and to capture uncertainty.

Characteristic spectral features make many pure materials identifiable from their visible-to-infrared spectra, but quantifying their presence within a mixture is a challenging task due to nonlinearities and factors of variation. In this paper, spectral variation is considered from a physics-based approach and incorporated into an end-to-end spectral unmixing algorithm via differentiable programming. The dispersion model is introduced to simulate realistic spectral variation, and an efficient method to fit the parameters is presented. Then, this dispersion model is utilized as a generative model within an analysis-by-synthesis spectral unmixing algorithm. Further, a technique for inverse rendering using a convolutional neural network to predict parameters of the generative model is introduced to enhance performance and speed when training data is available. Results achieve state-of-the-art on both infrared and visible-to-near-infrared (VNIR) datasets, and show promise for the synergy between physics-based models and deep learning in hyperspectral unmixing in the future.},

	abstract = {Endmember (EM) spectral variability can greatly impact the performance of standard hyperspectral image analysis algorithms. Extended parametric models have been successfully applied to account for the EM spectral variability. However, these models still lack the compromise between ﬂexibility and low-dimensional representation that is necessary to properly explore the fact that spectral variability is often conﬁned to a low-dimensional manifold in real scenes. In this paper we propose to learn a spectral variability model directly from the observed data, instead of imposing it a priori. This is achieved through a deep generative EM model, which is estimated using a variational autoencoder (VAE). The encoder and decoder that compose the generative model are trained using pure pixel information extracted directly from the observed image, what allows for an unsupervised formulation. The proposed EM model is applied to the solution of a spectral unmixing problem, which we cast as an alternating nonlinear least-squares problem that is solved iteratively with respect to the abundances and to the low-dimensional representations of the EMs in the latent space of the deep generative model. Simulations using both synthetic and real data indicate that the proposed strategy can outperform the competing state-of-the-art algorithms.},

abstract = {The mineral composition of a suite of igneous and metamorphic rocks was determined using the thermal infrared emission spectra of these rocks in a linear spectral deconvolution algorithm. This algorithm assumes that the infrared spectrum of each rock is a linear mixture of the component mineral spectra weighted by volume abundance. A diverse suite of 36 common rock-forming and accessory minerals was used in the deconvolution. The model was tested by comparing the mineralogy derived from the infrared spectrum with petrographically estimated abundances for 45 igneous and 51 metamorphic rock samples. The mineral abundances derived from these two techniques agree to within ±7–15\% for the primary minerals feldspar, pyroxene, quartz, and calcite/dolomite and ±9–17\% for secondary minerals such as micas and amphiboles. These differences are comparable to the error for traditional thin section mode estimates, which are ±5–15\% for major minerals and ≤5\% for minor minerals. The detection limit for the primary and secondary minerals found in the rocks analyzed ranged from 5 to 10\%. Each major rock type studied here was easily distinguished by its spectral characteristics. The best results, in both the qualitative determination of the rock type and dominant minerals and the quantitative reproduction of absorption features and mineral composition, were obtained for igneous rock samples. For metamorphic rocks, pelite and quartzo-feldspathic samples gave slightly better results than calcareous or mafic samples. A controlled analysis, in which the end-member suite was reduced based on an initial estimate of the rock type, only improved the results by several percent for most primary and secondary minerals. The quality of the obtained results demonstrates that a linear deconvolution of infrared emission spectra provides an accurate, rapid technique for determining the quantitative mineral composition of rock samples in a laboratory and has application to future in situ measurements.},
